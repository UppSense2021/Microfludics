# Microfludics
Fluid and Magnetophoresis simulations.

MagnetophoresisTesting.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook with initial 2D analysis of the bead drifting and uses mag_stregths.txt to model the strength of the magnetic field. mag_strengths.txt is taken from https://www.intemag.com/magnet-calculations-flux-vs-distance-rectangular-magnets, for an initial idea.
